(I would say Iâ€™m small-mid fat, US size 16-18) The member of staff told me and my whole group that I should use a double kayak â€œbecause of my weightâ€ but didnâ€™t back this up with an explanation. Maybe the kayaks here are cheaper and less sea worthy than others Iâ€™ve used previously. I did it anyway to save embarrassment and time because the process of getting us on the water was very slow. As it happened, the girl who shared with me was much smaller and the weight distribution was completely wrong due to this being a double kayak. I felt unsafe the whole time but luckily, as mentioned I am experienced and a very strong swimmer.  Then we had a great time all kayaking together and swimming together, but at the end another member of staff suggested we set up a photo for breast cancer awareness and told us to â€œform the shape of a ribbon with our kayaksâ€. She had no idea how to direct this and expected us to just know how to make the shape she envisioned with no help or leadership. We tried for about 10 minutes but all ended up very frustrated and cranky because we couldnâ€™t get this task right.

She was communicative & very present even before the tour with info & suggestions for the upcoming day.
Punctual & a delight to be around.
Her aura & energy was positive & infectious.
She was a wealth of information.
If she did not know something she was honest & said so but would at the same time look up/ find out that unknown information.
She always had good suggestions & what I really liked is that she asked me for my input & what I wanted to do.
She was also thoughtful & caring & made me want to gladly book again which I will surely do the next time visiting the city. 
Do not hesitate or be afraid to book one of her tours.
You will NOT  regret it !

Madain Saleh Tours,20287897,4,4,1,"I visited Alula and took the Maidan Saleh tour. On the tour there was a man that harassed me, he kept taking pictures of me and saying very inappropriate jokes all while I was there with my babies husband and mother. I feel very disrespected and shocked. This man felt that it was ok for him to behave the way he did in front of my my and husband. 

When we complained to the tour guide (Ziad) who also claimed to be a manager, he told us to go to hell and thatâ€™s our problem. He made us go sit in the bus and end the tour. Security was called which I thought was going to solve the problem but that wasnâ€™t the case. The man that harassed me, Ziad, and the security guy all worked together as a team, they were all protecting each other. When we realized they were a team, my husband confronted the man that harassed me and he said he was only taking snapchat pictures and itâ€™s not a big deal, he even showed the picture like itâ€™s nothing. The picture had my family in it. I asked for the US Embassy to be called, I asked for law enforcement to be present as we felt unsafe but none of those requests were answered. We were frightened and scared. They basically bullied us for complaining about the man that kept harassing me. 

We waited for them to respond for two hours sitting in the heat with our children. When we went back to Ziad and asked what was going on he told us go walk home if you donâ€™t want to wait. So we paid for a tour in which we were harassed, bullied and trapped. We never got an apology and I donâ€™t think it would help this case at this point. 

We came all the way from America (Denver Colorado) to visit this site and now we feel so disgusted, upset and disrespected. We will never come here again and report this as sexual harassment. We will not recommend this experience to anyone we know. How can a big organization like this have such horrible and unprofessional tour guides. We complained to several people, sent emails and heard nothing. We were not taken seriously at all.

Al Masjid an Nabawi,319516,,5,5,"Please see my other page on Makkah for tips and my review.

We travelled by high speed train from Makkah to Medinah â€“ covering the distance in just over 2 hours with one stop in Jeddah. 

Stayed at the Sofitel which is the closest to the womenâ€™s entrance gate 25 (about 5 minutes walk).

Compared to Makkah, Medinah was so organised and quiet, managed to pray inside the prophetâ€™s mosque with no hassle, plenty of chairs for those that canâ€™t sit down and water barrels all over to take a drink of Zamzam water.

Now for some key points to arm yourselves with.

â€¢	Praying at namaz times is easy to navigate and inside and you can get there at Azaan time and still get a space
â€¢	For men, you can walk past the prophet tomb with no booking required. Entrance is close to the south entrances and signposted. Be prepared to queue but lines are kept moving by security
â€¢	Rawdah â€“ to pray in Noble Rawdah, you have to book on the Nusk app as this is required to reduce overcrowding. This is mandatory and QR code on the app will be scanned. You get a choice of times and arrive about 20 minutes before as you will need to queue. If you arrive too early, you will be turned away.
â€¢	Jannatul Baqi graveyard â€“ no booking needed and there is a path going through which is moving one way. Again lines are kept moving. Entrance is by south west part of mosque by the Lost Children centre.
â€¢	ZamZam water â€“ you can take back home one 5l water which you collect from Jeddah airport or Medinah airport.  Just show your passport at the dedicated section outside of departures to collect the bottle. Note, you should only take the water from the airport as these are packaged for air travel. You canâ€™t open them until you reach your destination. Another note, if you are flying straight home, then the water is not counted as part of your luggage. However, if you decide to do a stopover on your way home (so going to Dubai and then back home), the water on you final flight back is counted with your luggage so bear in mind the total weight

Overall a great trip and an experience to be able to visit these two beautiful places. However, slightly let down by the overzealous guards in Makkah and the inconsiderate people who think it is a race to do Tawaf around the Kaaba â€“ we even saw one man taking a business call whilst walking around, seriously, some people have no understanding of why there are there.",en,"King Abdul Aziz Rd Central Madina, Medina 42311 Saudi Arabia",39.61115,24.467182,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d319516-Reviews-Al_Masjid_an_Nabawi-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,http://wmn.gov.sa,42311,Sacred & Religious Sites,Masjid Nabawi is one of the most important landmarks in the history of Islam.

We arrived here by car, which is essential for a complete and independent visit. The main reason tourists come here is Hegra, which alone is worth a visit than Al Ula. We booked the visits to Dadan & Jabal Ikmah and the Old Town online. For the first one, as well as for Hegra, we parked in Winter park while for the second one we used the Old Town North Parking although we can also confirm that Old Town South Parking is closer to the starting point of the tour. The walking tour of the oasis (oasis trail) can be started from several points even if we have considered the best solution to use the car parking located on the other side of the road at the south end of the Old Town.  Among the things to do at sunset without a doubt Elephant Rock and the Harrat viewpoint are unmissable. Al Ula offers many other opportunities for visits and recreation and among them Rainbow Rock and Maraya cannot fail to be mentioned for its uniqueness.

First sight on entering the main gate was of a run down alleyway with many broken and old pieces of junk which I am sure were of no value or history. Ticket cost is 25 SAR per adult which is good value for whatâ€™s offered. We were given shoe covers to keep the inside of the museum clean and tidy and were assigned an English speaking guide. Other language are also available. The guide walked us through the history of Madinah, the wars of Uhud and Khandaq, the evolution of the masjid nabwi and the house of Aisha r.a. - all explained through models of the various buildings which was highly education and enjoyable.

TOURIST GUIDE AHMAD ALJUAED,19259014,13,4.5,5,"Oh boy, let me tell you about our incredible adventure with the Discover Taif City private tour! It all started with the one and only Ahmad Aljuaed, the master of communication. This guy was on top of his game, reaching out to us via email and WhatsApp to make sure everything was set for our last-minute and unpredictable arrival. Talk about being proactive!

     But the real star of the show was our guide, Saad. Let me just say, this guy knows his stuff! Not only did he give us a warm welcome, but he also took us on an epic journey through the history and spiritual significance of Taif, all in flawless English. I mean, Taif has so much to offer, you need a knowledgeable guide to help you learn the warm hospitality of Taif Mecca culture. 

     Now, here's the highlight of the trip â€šthe cable car ride to Al Hada Mountain. Oh boy, the views were out of this world! We were floating in the sky, taking in the breathtaking scenery. Trust me, you can't miss this. It's like being on top of the world, literally!

     And of course, being the city of roses, we couldn't leave Taif without visiting the rose oil refinery. The aroma was intoxicating, and learning about the process was fascinating. It's like a sweet-smelling science experiment, but way cooler.

    But wait, there's more! We explored Rudaf Park and Shubra Palace, diving into the depths of history. It was like stepping back in time, only with better Wi-Fi. And let's not forget the shopping in the old souk, sipping mint tea, and snagging unique souvenirs. It was like a cultural treasure hunt, and we were winning!

    To wrap it all up, we indulged in the hearty Taif cuisine, made with locally sourced ingredients. Let me tell you, our taste buds were dancing with joy! It was like a party in our mouths, and we were the VIP guests.

     All in all, this tour was hands down one of the best I've ever taken around the world. The mix of history, culture, breathtaking views, and delicious food created memories that will last a lifetime. So, when you find yourself in Taif, don't even think twice â€šbook the Discover Taif City private tour and get ready to have the time of your life. Trust me, you won't regret it. It's a journey worth treasuring forever!

Fakieh Aquarium,4020986,541,4,4,"I enjoyed my visit to the Fakieh Aquarium. It is situated more to the Northern area of the corniche.
The entry ticket cost me 65 riyals. I didnâ€™t have the option of incorporating the dolphin show. I presume these shows are only on at certain times and when there are more visitors.
My visit was in the early afternoon and the aquarium was very quiet of visitors, making it a better experience for me and allowing me to properly look at each exhibit.
I thought each of the exhibits were well kept and very animal looked well cared for. The whole aquarium was immaculately clean, particularly important when you are walking through the glass tunnel and marvelling at all the sea life around you.
I do care about animal conservation and so it is important to me their living conditions. I do not like exploited animal tourism. Fakieh Aquarium seeks to educate the visitor. 
Yes, the building is slightly dated but it was well laid out and I imagine it is very popular with children. A lot of the signage is aimed at a younger audience and there is also an area where under strict supervision, children can put their hands into the sea water and experience the sea creatures (star fish etc) I think this is fun and educational at the same time.
I was slightly saddened and disappointed when I saw the penguin enclosure. There was only one penguin and although he/she seemed full of life, I thought they were social animals. 
The aquarium has a couple of gift shops selling souvenirs and sweets and also restaurants and snack/cafe choices.
I think my impression of the place was a positive one, particularly due to how quiet it was.

Edge of The World,5053663,395,5,5,"October 2024.  We had a truly awesome half-day trip to the Edge. We had a great guide named Hashem and highly recommend texting or calling him for a tour. (Hashem is on WhatsApp +966 54 846 1616).  He speaks very good english.  He picked us up at our hotel on time at 2pm for a â€œsunset tourâ€ in a nice SUV - a Tahoe.  Very comfortable ride with good music - about 2 hours there, 2 hours back, depending on which part of a Riyadh you are in. Hashem took GREAT pictures - much better than the ones we took.  At the end, he surprised us with Saudi coffee, tea, water, dates and mixed nuts as we watched the sun set.  We talked the whole time in english about Saudi culture, food, language, and current events, etc..  we had a special request to stop somewhere at the end and he patiently took us there as well. He does tours to other places in the city too.  Highly recommend!
About The Edge-  recommend reserving 24 hours in advance (we were very lucky Hashem was available on short notice of only 2 hours). Guides can do two tours a day and it is usually broken up into a sunrise and a sunset time tour. There are two â€œhikesâ€- a 30 minute and a 3 hour hike. We did the 30 minute hike and it was perfect. The 3 hour hike goes from the top to the bottom and back up, with steep paths and large steps.  If you want to walk even less than 30 min, it looks like the vehicles could drive closer to the end of the upper trail where everyone takes pictures.

This complex comprises seven mosques intricately linked to the Prophet's life and the Battle of Khandaq (the Trench), which was a defensive trench dug by Muslims to protect Medina from the advancing armies of Quraysh and their allies in 5 A.H. The defenders of Medina were stationed in these mosques, each named after the individual stationed there, except for Al-Fath Mosque. Proceeding from north to south, the mosques are Al-Fath Mosque, Salman Al-Farsi Mosque, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq Mosque, Umar bin Khattab Mosque, Ali bin Abi Talib Mosque, Fatimah Az-Zahra Mosque, Saad ibn Moâ€™az Mosque, and Qiblatain Mosque. Although the Qiblatain Mosque is one kilometer away from the others, it is included because pilgrims visiting the first six mosques typically also visit the Qiblatain Mosque.

Al Wahbah crater,2249334,76,4.5,4,"The Al Wahbah crater is a 3km wide 250m deep volcano caldera with a white carpet of sodium phosphate across the interior. Itâ€™s an impressive sight and worth seeing. 

However! Important notes:

1. Whilst it is technically possible to climb down into the crater, you are not actually allowed to do so and security to patrol the area. This is because people have struggled to get back out in the past.

2. There is no obvious campsite in the volcano rim and itâ€™s very difficult to peg tents into the hard ground. However around 300m to the north of the crater there are lava flows with sandy beds in between which provide cover and better camping

3. The terrain is hard, stony and ridged. Take a spare tyre and go in a vehicle that can handle rugged off-roading 

4. By day we found it to be sunny and pleasant. At night the temperature dropped and there was a howling wind which others had reported so it wasnâ€™t a one-off! See point 2 above. But take a sturdy and/or low tent

5. Itâ€™s quite some way from any significant settlement, so time and plan accordingly if not camping overnight",en,"Hafir Kishb, Taif Saudi Arabia",41.13233,22.906122,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298553-d2249334-Reviews-Al_Wahbah_crater-Taif_Makkah_Province.html,http://alwaba.com/,,Geologic Formations,

There are no prayer mats so please bring your own. The restrooms are also closed so you have to perform wudhu before you get here.

I visited here for the first time last year after Ramadhan thinking it was open for jummah prayers.

It is still closed to the public.

Recently I got to visit it and prayed in congregation outside with a few brothers. It's very beautiful. During the day there is a good breeze and you can hear the birds chirping I the bushes outside the masjid. Which is a very pleasing to hear.

My favorite part was finding a Chuck E Cheese's branch in the plaza. It's the best one in the city because it's not too crowded, so you can have a fun time without feeling overwhelmed. There aren't too many restaurants, but you still have a few options to choose from.

One thing I really liked about Thaghr Plaza is that it's not too busy, so it's nice and peaceful. They also have a big parking lot, which makes it easy to find a spot for your car.

Wadi Tayyib Al Ism,19821001,4,5,5,"We were thrilled with our visit to Tayyib Al Ism.  We spent 4 months working with Zahid from a Tabuk Travel Agency (WhatsApp +966553790040) to get permits to allow us to visit.  They cost $20 each, and he obtained them for us, and emailed them to us.  We printed them out and took them with us and the military personnel that control entry looked at the paperwork and smiled and let us through.  I worried something would go wrong, but nothing did.  It was very professional and perfect.  For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, there's a high probability that this is the Valley of Lemuel.  If so, it's where Lehi based his family after leaving from Jerusalem.  It's where the brothers left from to get the plates and the family of Ismael.  Its where Lehi received the Tree of Life vision; where a revelation on the birth, life, crucifixions, and resurrection of Christ was given; where a revelation on the coming forth of America and the Book of Mormon was received; and where the Liahona was given.  It was a pretty special visit.  Moslems believe that this is where Moses and the Israelites crossed the Red Sea.

Jabal Thawr,23815655,1,5,5,"This is the cave that the prophet (saw) and his companion (ra) escaped to save their lives while being chased by trackers. Itâ€™s a steep mountain. Anyone with back problems of any kind or mobility concerns should not attempt this mountain. It takes 2 hours for an able bodied person to climb and up to 4 hours for anyone else. Rocks are steep and the journey is treacherous winding up the mountain. You are constantly near to cliff edges there are no barriers to stop you falling so you must have good treads on your shoes to grip. You go up and down the same way. Many people will be using the same route as you. There are small hut shops dotted along the route so you can buy water and snacks if yours run out. I highly recommend a sugar fix maybe juice or chocolate to normalise your blood pressure for when you reach the top. There is a snack hut at the top. And no there are no toilets along any of the route. When you reach the top access to the small cave is tiny. Only a few people can fit. There will be a small queue for those wanting to offer prayers inside the cave. Coming down is harder than upwards because gravity will make you go faster. Many people fall and slip on the gravel on the way down. Take it slow. Donâ€™t try and be fast, or smart. You cannot outwit nature. I saw people with diabetes, high blood pressure, old age, mobility issues, cry tears of pain and exhaustion having come so far and have to turn back because the physical pain was just too much to bear. If you have to walk a lot the next day then this uphill climb is not for you. It will leave you exhausted, tired, and ladies will get swollen ankles and feet. Go with a positive mindset. Take it very slow. Good grip shoes or trainers. Take snacks and liquids. Set aside at least 3 to 4 hours uphill. And 2 hours downhill. When you get to the top it is worth seeing and feeling what the Beloved had to go through. A spiritual place indeed. Donâ€™t worship it.

Completed in May 1997 at a cost of over Saudi Riyals 24,610,000 (over $6,500,000) it is a good and clean masjid, featuring a separate women's section, wheelchair accessibility, a big ablution area, clean toilets, and a large parking area. The big park is generally used for walking, cycling, picnicking, and a playing area for kids. It is a monument in Khobar city. Close to this mosque are many civic facilities including a hypermarket, petrol station, fast food, restaurants, banks and ATM machines, etc. Adjacent to the mosque is a funeral home or mortuary where the last rituals of a dead person are held. Usually, the janaza (funeral) prayers are offered here and then the deceased is taken to the Thuqbah graveyard.",en,"King Fahd Road, Al Khobar 34626 Saudi Arabia",46.614956,24.824736,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298545-d25214834-Reviews-King_Fahd_Grand_Mosque-Al_Khobar_Eastern_Province.html,,34626,Sacred & Religious Sites,

Angawi House,27799399,1,4,4,"I did a lot of research into Angawi House on my recent visit to Jeddah.
The house is privately owned and lived in by Dr Sami Angawi and his family.
Dr Angawi was born in Mecca and is an authority on Saudi Arabian architecture. The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.
Dr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning 
The house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawiâ€™s wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.
I discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.
There was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.
The research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.
It is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.
I would have loved to see the interior of this architectural masterpiece",en,"3111 Sameer Bin Kaeb Ash Shanti, Jeddah 23412 Saudi Arabia",39.11939,21.562233,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295419-d27799399-Reviews-Angawi_House-Jeddah_Makkah_Province.html,,23412,Architectural Buildings,

Historical Places of Medina,26770176,1,5,5,"During my job in Saudi Arabia from 1974 to 1996, and during my subsequent visits, I had the chance to explore numerous historical, religious, and ancient landmarks. TripAdvisor published my 63 reviews, and I've selected 10 noteworthy attractions:
1.	Hejaz Railway Station: Opened in 1908 and closed in 1920, the Ottoman Empire built this railway and ran from Damascus to Medina. It fell into disrepair after the Arab Revolt of 1917.
2.	Battle of Badr Memorial: This memorial lists the names of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) who were martyred in the first battle for Islam.
3.	Masjid al-Fasâ€™ah: The demolished remains at the foot of Mount Uhud mark where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) offered Dhuhr prayer during the Battle of Uhud.
4.	Masjid al-Fatah: This mosque marks the site where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) supplicated during the Battle of Khandaq and received glad tidings of victory from Allah.
5.	Masjid al-Ghamama: Located 300 meters southwest of Masjid-e-Nabawi, this mosque was built where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) performed Eid salah in his later years.
6.	Masjid Jumah: This mosque marks the spot where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) led the first-ever Jummah prayer with about 100 companions.
7.	Masjid al-Raâ€™yah: Situated on Mount Dhubab, this mosque marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) pitched his tent while digging the trench for the Battle of Khandaq.
8.	Masjid al-Shaikhain: This mosque marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) prayed on the eve of the Battle of Uhud and prepared for the battle.
9.	Mount Uhud: Located north of Medina, this mountain was the site of the second battle between the Muslim community of Medina and the Quraysh tribe from Makkah.
10.	Qiblah Change Pillar: This pillar, located near Bab-e-Jibraeel, marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) led prayer in Medina when the Qiblah was towards Masjid al-Aqsa, opposite Makkah.",en,"Haram, Medina Saudi Arabia",39.61417,24.46861,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d26770176-Reviews-Historical_Places_of_Medina-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,,,Ancient Ruins,

The road up to Bjeddah though unpaved is in good condition. The whole eastern area is a desert with unconnected rocky areas. Following the existing tire tracks or simply moving among the rocks you can drive in the whole area if you have a 4x4 and GPS. This area is, with certain differences, the southward continuation of Jordan's famous Wadi Rum. The bottom of the ground on which the car is moving does not have significant sandy areas (we have not deflated the tires). Moving in these desert areas among the rocks you can take excellent photographs in which the warm colors of the desert and rocks are clearly highlighted against the background of the blue sky.

The House Of Syeda Fatima Bint Al-Husayn,27551401,1,4,4,"When visiting Makkah and Madinah, our purpose extends beyond performing Umrah and offering prayers at the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) mosque. We are drawn to these sacred cities by a desire to explore their rich religious, historical, and cultural significance, steeped in the spiritual aura of Islam. During our recent visit to Madinah, we had the privilege of visiting the house of Syeda Fatimah bint Husayn, a place deeply entrenched in history. She built this house and a well inside it when she moved from her grandmother Fatima's (RA) house. This move was necessitated when Fatima's house became part of the expanding Prophet's Mosque. Syeda Fatimah remained in Madinah while her father participated in the battle of Karbala, where he ultimately met his martyrdom in 110 AH. Fatima was also present in Karbala and was later taken as a captive to Kufa and then to Damascus, along with other members of Imam Hussain's family. Despite the hardships she endured, Fatima played a crucial role as a narrator of the tragic events of Karbala and its aftermath. It is said that Syeda Fatimah's resemblance to her grandmother, Fatima (RA), the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), was striking, adding a poignant layer to her story. Her life and experiences are a testament to the resilience and strength of faith that characterize the descendants of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).",en,"Al Usayfirin, Medina 42315 Saudi Arabia",39.61417,24.46861,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298551-d27551401-Reviews-The_House_Of_Syeda_Fatima_Bint_Al_Husayn-Medina_Al_Madinah_Province.html,,42315,Historic Sites,

We were surprised to see a road sign to Roman theater so went to discover and explore. The site is still under construction but gives lovely views across the coastline and hopefully when finished will be a great venue with water in the moat and toilet / refreshments on site. Glad we visited while in the area. No petrol stations, cafes, shops in the area and nearest toilet facilities we found were at the beach so take these into account when visiting the area.
